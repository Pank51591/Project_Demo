    <ol>
        <li>Click on the "Start Tuning" button. The "Automatic Tuning Processing" Dialog Box will be displayed.</li>
        <li>Follow the instructions displayed in the "Automatic Tuning Processing" Dialog Box to start tuning.</li>
        <li>For example, in the tuning of touch-interface buttons, automatic tuning of a single button involves one time measurement. Touch the target button according to the instructions shown in this dialog. After that, press any key (e.g. Y) on the keyboard.</li>
        <li>For the automatic adjustment of 3D gesture (AI), place your hand at the height where you want the 3D gesture to be recognized and press any key on the keyboard.</li>
        <li>After the tuning of all touch interfaces is finished, the result will be displayed. Close the "Automatic Tuning Processing" Dialog Box if there are no problems. Otherwise (e.g. when you have failed to touch the touch interface in the tuning process), select the target touch interface and press the "Retry" button to start re-tuning.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Before clicking on the "Start Tuning" button, confirm that executing the user program from the reset vector up to the beginning of the main function is possible and the e<sup>2</sup> studio is disconnected from the emulator.</li>
        <li>If you are not using the main function, replace the function name in the Debug Configurations dialog of the e<sup>2</sup> studio so that the execution of the user program will stop at the beginning of a desired user application.</li>
        <li>If "Advanced mode" is checked, settings related to tuning can be made. However, if you will set these values inadvertently or without clear understanding, it could lead to poor tuning results.</li>
