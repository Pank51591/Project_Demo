            A free gesture can be registered as long as it can be determined from the waveforms of the touch sensor by the decision algorithm using deep learning (AI) that is generated by the QE. However, it is more likely that gestures with similar signal waveforms cannot be distinguished from each other.<br>
            Example: A tap with the right palm and a tap with the left palm produce waveforms of the same shape and so are not distinguished from each other.
